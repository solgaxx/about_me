ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Solenn.

ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Computer Science.
I am an Information Systems major at the University of Delaware.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Java and C++.
I already learned most of the basics of Python, Racket, and Html.

âš¡ Fun facts:

I am French and also a bit German.

I like coding games.
For instance, I coded a snake game that I called "Jake the Snake".

During Summer 2022, I will attend a Summer School in Paris to do some coding applicated to games.
This training course or coding experience that will last 14 days is organized by ISART Digital.
